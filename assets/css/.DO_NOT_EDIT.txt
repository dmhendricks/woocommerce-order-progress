Do not edit the CSS files in the directory - they are automatically
generated/compiled with SASS. Doing so may result in your changes being
overwritten.

To make changes to style, modify the appropriate file in the ../scss directory
and use a SASS compiler to generate the CSS file(s).

A good compiler is Koala (http://koala-app.com/). Just point it to the ../scss
folder, make your changes to the SCSS file(s), and click compile. It will
automatically generate the CSS file(s) here.

(This only applies if SASS is being used to manage and compile CSS output.)
